# Automated Backup Script Documentation

## Overview

The Automated Backup Script is a Bash script designed to facilitate the automatic backup of specific files to a USB drive when it is connected to the system. This script is useful for users who want to ensure regular backups of important data without manual intervention.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Automated Backup Script, make sure you have the following:

- A USB drive properly mounted on your system.
- The `rsync` command installed. You can install it using your system's package manager.

## Configuration

1. Open the `usb_backup.sh` file in a text editor.

2. Set the `source_directory` variable to the path of the directory you want to back up.

    ```bash
    source_directory="/path/to/source"
    ```

3. Set the `usb_directory` variable to the path where the USB drive is mounted.

    ```bash
    usb_directory="/path/to/usb/drive"
    ```

## Usage

1. Save the script with the configured settings.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.

3. Make the script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x usb_backup.sh
    ```

4. Run the script:

    ```bash
    ./usb_backup.sh
    ```

## Notes

- The script checks if the USB drive is connected by verifying the existence of the specified directory. If the USB drive is detected, the backup process is initiated using the `rsync` command.

- Customize the script further based on your specific needs and system configuration.

## Troubleshooting

- If the backup is not working as expected, check the terminal for error messages or review the script for any misconfigurations.
